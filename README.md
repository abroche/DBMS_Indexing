## Section I: Compilation and Execution Guide

1. **Run Main**:
   Execute the main program.

2. **Execute Commands**:
   Once the program is running, execute one of the following commands:
    - The "create" command is hardcoded exactly as given in the project description.
    - Select commands are not case sensitive but require all parts specified in the project description.

3. **Looping Execution**:
   After executing a command, the program will ask for input again, creating a loop after each command.

**Note:** There is no error checking on inputs.

## Section II: Test Results

I manually tested the code, and it worked as specified.

## Section III: Design Decisions

No extra design decisions were made.
